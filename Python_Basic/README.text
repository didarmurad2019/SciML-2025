# 🐍 Python Basics

A quick reference guide for beginners:

## 1. Print something
```python
print("Hello, World!")

# Keywords and Variables

After completing the simple python tutorial your kids will develop proficiency in the Python framework and eventually about creating and building fun games and projects

| Term            | What It Means                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Class**       | A recipe or blueprint for creating objects       |
| **Object**      | A real item made using the class                 |
| **Method**      | A function that belongs to an object             |
| **Data member** | A variable that stores information in the object |

# Variables

name = "Alice"      # string
age = 25            # integer
height = 5.6        # float
is_student = True   # boolean

# Data Types🧪 
<br>
Every value in Python has a data type. Some common ones:
<br>
int (whole numbers) → age = 12
<br>
float (decimal numbers) → height = 4.5
<br>
str (text/strings) → name = "Emma"
<br>
list (a group of items) → colors = ["red", "blue"]
<br>
bool (True/False) → is_happy = True

# Operators ➕ 
<br>
Python uses symbols to perform math or comparisons.
<br>
🔢 Arithmetic Operators:
<br>

| Operator | Example  | Result               |
| -------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| `+`      | `5 + 3`  | `8` (Addition)       |
| `-`      | `6 - 2`  | `4` (Subtract)       |
| `/`      | `8 / 4`  | `2.0` (Divide)       |
| `*`      | `3 * 2`  | `6` (Multiply)       |
| `%`      | `5 % 2`  | `1` (Remainder)      |
| `//`     | `6 // 5` | `1` (Floor Division) |
| `**`     | `3 ** 2` | `9` (Power)          |

<br>
Other operator types: Comparison, Logical, Assignment, Identity, and Membership.
<br>
​The Python shell can perform the above arithmetic operations because it is an interpreter where you can execute your Python code and commands. The Python shell has many other features, including adding a shell page.

# Functions 🧩 
<br>
A function is a set of instructions you can run whenever you want.
<br>
Functions help organize code into smaller chunks.

# Loops🔁 
<br>
Loops repeat a task multiple times. It is a set of instructions that are repeated until a certain condition is reached. In this structure There are two main types:

# While Loop➿
<br>
Tests the condition before execution of the body of the loop

# For Loop🔁
<br>
abbreviates the code of the managing loop variable and executes a sequence of statements multiple times

# Nested Loops (loop inside a loop)🌀
<br>
Nested Loops: these are used within other loops

# What Is an Object and a Class 🧱 ?
💡 Think of a class as a recipe and an object as the real cupcake made from that recipe! 🍰
<br>
🧱 Example: Let's Build a Dog Class!
🐶 Step-by-step:
We will create a Dog class, and then use it to make some dog objects.
<br>

# What's Happening 🧠?
<br>
class Dog: — this is our blueprint for any dog.
<br>
__init__ is a special method that runs when we make a new dog. It sets the name and age.
<br>
self.name and self.age are data members — they belong to each dog.
<br>
bark() and birthday() are methods — they belong to the dog and do actions.
